# GoogleMapsClone
<b>Mapbox</b> is an incredibly powerful tool for creating map-based applications, but it can be daunting to get started. This project fetches data from Mapbox and displays a real-time world map with features similar to Google Maps. It also utilizes the browser's <b>Geolocation API</b> as well as various Mapbox plugins.
### Features:
The features included in this project are:
- **Real-Time Navigation**: Navigate through a real-time world map.
- **Shortest Path Calculation**: The application displays the shortest path between two destinations.
- **Transport Mode Options**: It shows the time taken by different modes of transport (Traffic, Driving, Cycling, Walking).
